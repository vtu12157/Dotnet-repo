No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   welcome.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .vs/
        GitDemo/
        bash
        desktop.ini


It took 2.00 seconds to enumerate untracked files. 'status -uno'
may speed it up, but you have to be careful not to forget to add
new files yourself (see 'git help status').
